# C_Program-BankLoanManagement-
"A C program for evaluating and approving bank loan applications based on customer credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio, and employment history. It calculates loan eligibility, adjusts credit thresholds, and displays the results for both approved and rejected loans."


Bank Loan Approval System

This C program simulates a bank's loan approval system that evaluates and approves loan applications based on customer data. The system calculates credit scores and checks eligibility for loan approval based on factors like income, debt-to-income ratio, years of employment, and red loans.
Features

    Customer Data Entry: Input customer details such as income, requested loan amount, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), years of employment, and red loan status.
    Credit Score Calculation: The program calculates the credit score based on the customer's financial information, adjusting for factors like income, DTI, employment, and existing red loans.
    Loan Approval: Customers are evaluated for loan eligibility based on predefined criteria (e.g., minimum income, credit score threshold, no red loans).
    Loan Evaluation & Adjustment: If the total approved loans do not meet the target, the system adjusts the credit score threshold and re-evaluates loan applications.
    Result Display: The program displays detailed information about each customer, the approved loans, and the total loan amount approved.

How It Works
